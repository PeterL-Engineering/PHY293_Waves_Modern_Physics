% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.

% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTex{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTex{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
This project addresses the challenge of automated colourization for 256$\times$256 grayscale images using a dataset of 12,600 image pairs, balanced across human subjects, 
animals, and natural scenery. We frame colourization as a supervised learning problem in the CIELAB colour space, where a model predicts chrominance channels ($a^*$, $b^*$) 
from the luminance channel ($L^*$). A shallow convolutional neural network (CNN) provides the baseline performance, while our primary solution employs a deeper convolutional 
encoder-decoder architecture. This design captures high-level semantic features and spatial context, addressing limitations of shallow networks in perceptual realism.

\section{Introduction}

Standard AC and DC circuit theory makes the assumption that the speed of information propagation in a circuit is ideal and is infinite.
Thus, if a change occurs anywhere along the circuit, then the rest of the circuit will respond instantaneously to that change.
In reality, pulses are limited by the physical properties of the cable insulator, and do not travel nearly as fast as the speed of light.

\section{Background Information}



\subsection{The Ideal Transmission Line}

Transmission lines can be abstracted as discrete repeated networks of inducts (L) and capcitors (C) that can store and transmit electric and magnetic energy.
The most foundational block of an ideal transmission line is an LC element of lenght $dx$ and zero electric resistance \textbf{REFERENCE IMAGE OF TRANSMISSION LINE}

\textbf{INSERT IMAGE OF TRANSMISSION LINE CIRCUIT HERE}

We can represent these as waves by first analysing the rates of change for both current I and voltage V take into account the self inductance of the element ($L_0dx$) and its capacitance ($C_0dx$)

\[
\frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = -L_0\frac{\partial I}{\partial t}, \quad \frac{\partial I}{\partial x} = -C_0\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}
\]

From these rates of change, we can obtain the wave equations for voltage and current:

\[
\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial x^2} = L_0C_0\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial t^2}, \quad \frac{\partial^2 I}{\partial x^2} = L_0C_0\frac{\partial^2 I}{\partial t^2}
\]
